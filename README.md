# E-Commerce Website ðŸš€

## Introduction ðŸ““

An e-commerce site, or an online store, is a website that allows users to purchase goods or services over the internet. E-commerce sites typically have an online catalog of products that customers can browse, as well as a shopping cart and checkout process to complete the purchase. Some e-commerce sites also offer additional features such as customer reviews, personalized recommendations, and the ability to track orders and returns. E-commerce sites are a popular way for businesses to reach a wide audience and sell their products online, and for customers to shop for items from the convenience of their own devices.
